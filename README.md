# SIPped - 
SIPped is a tool for reproducing SIP signaling scenarios to support functional testing needs, including multiple call flows per session, auto-reregistration, and advanced features such as BLA and SCA. External scripts can be called to automate actions to devices under test, allowing the resulting scenarios to be incorporated into a automation framework for use with feature, regression and smoke testing. 

SIPped (the past tense of SIP) is based on the open source SIPp project with significant enhancements to facilitate functional testing, include files, XML-standards compliance and ease of use.  While it contains many enhancements to facilitate scenarios not possible in the original SIPp implementation, unless the new -mc option is passed, it continues to operate as a performance / load testing tool. 

See SIPped Reference Guide.docx for user manual.
